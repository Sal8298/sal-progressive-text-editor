# sal-progressive-text-editor

  ## Description

Sal Progressive Text Editor was made to demonstrate what I have learnt about PWA's. It is an application that allows the user to make notes. It can be used both offline and offline by saving data to localstorage. While making it, I learnt how to use IndexDb, configure serivce workers and how to transform an existing application into PWA format.
